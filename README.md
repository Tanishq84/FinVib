# **Finvib - Decentralized Microfinance Platform**

### **Overview**
**Finvib** is a decentralized microfinance platform designed to promote **financial inclusion** for underserved populations in India, especially in rural areas and among marginalized communities such as transgender individuals. The platform leverages **blockchain technology** for transparency and trust, **AI-driven credit scoring** using alternative data, and **financial literacy tools** to empower users with knowledge and access to fair financial services.

### **Problem**
- **Financial Exclusion**: Over 190 million adults in India remain unbanked, with rural and marginalized communities struggling to access financial services.
- **Lack of Credit Access**: Traditional banking systems exclude individuals without formal credit histories, such as small business owners, farmers, and women-led self-help groups.
- **Transparency Issues**: Conventional financial systems are often perceived as opaque and untrustworthy by underserved populations.

### **Solution**
Finvib addresses these challenges by:
- **Blockchain Integration**: Ensures transparency and fraud prevention through smart contract-driven loan disbursements and repayments.
- **Dynamic Credit Scoring**: Uses alternative data (e.g., utility bills, mobile payments) to assess creditworthiness for individuals lacking traditional credit history.
